Encryption and Decryption Notes......


1. The System.Security.Cryptography namespace in the mirosoft .net framework provides a variety of tools to help us with 
   encryption and with decryption.
2. The crypto stream class is design to encrypt or to decrypt content as it is streamed out to the file.
3. To encrypt and decrypt the file we have to generate a key.
4. The DESCryptoServiceProvider is based on a symmetric encryption algorithm.
5. The symmetric encription requires the key and an initialization vector(IV) to encrypt the data.
6. To decrypt the data we must have the same key and the same initialization vector(IV).
7. We must also use the same encryption algorithm.
8. However we can generate the keys by using neither of the following methods:
    a. get the password from the user and use it as a key and initialization vector.
    b. when we create a new instance of symmetric crypto graphy class, a new key and initialization vector are automatically
       created key and initialization vector are generated by the managed symmetric cryptography class to encrypt and to
       decrypt the file.
